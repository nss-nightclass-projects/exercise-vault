# The Zen Garden Challenge

## Setup

> Create a new repo on github called zen-garden

> Create a setup branch and do the usual.

## Requirements

Visit [CSS Zen Garden](https://www.csszengarden.com)  and explore some of the designs.  Pick a design you like and recreate it.

Think carefully about how you create your HTML to ensure that it appropriately uses semantic and non semantic tags.

Your CSS should be clean and well organized.

You should be using flex to position everything.  Very few of the examples actually use flex so it may be hard (or sometimes impossible) to get things looking exactly like the one you are seeing - this is OK.
