# The Zen Garden Challenge

## Setup

> Create a new repo on github
> Create an `exercise` branch and get working.

## Requirements

Visit [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/examples)  and explore some of the designs.  Pick a design you like and recreate it.

Think carefully about how you create your HTML to ensure that it appropriately uses semantic and non semantic tags.

Your CSS should be clean and well organized.
