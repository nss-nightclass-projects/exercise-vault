### Challenges

#### Challenge 1: Switch up the colors!
1. Design your application and use some colors that aren't weird or boring.
2. Use [a tool called Material Palette](https://www.materialpalette.com/) and pick 2 colors and you will get a resulting palette. You can click to download and then select "CSS" and you will get a file that looks like this:
```
/* Palette generated by Material Palette - materialpalette.com/brown/teal */

.dark-primary-color    { background: #5D4037; }
.default-primary-color { background: #795548; }
.light-primary-color   { background: #D7CCC8; }
.text-primary-color    { color: #FFFFFF; }
.accent-color          { background: #009688; }
.primary-text-color    { color: #212121; }
.secondary-text-color  { color: #757575; }
.divider-color         { border-color: #BDBDBD; }
```
3. Modify your CSS and/or HTML classes to incorporate this new color palette.

#### Challenge 2: Switch up the font!
1. Pick font(s) from [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/) and include them in your project. You can use them wherever you want, but uh, don't make it too ugly. 

#### Challenge 3: Sold out.
1. For items that are no longer available, place [this image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morecallan/css102-e6/master/images/soldOut.png) over top of the product card. **Note this is complex positioning, it is going to challenge you.**.
