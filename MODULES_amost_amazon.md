# Almost Amazon

## Instructions
You will be building a modular version of the greatest book store known to humankind - Almost Amazon.  This bookstore has a single book (of your choosing) and some awesome realated styling (if you would like).  

At minimum your Almost Amazon site should have:
1. A store with a single book
1. The ability to put the book in your cart 

## Tech Requirements
This assignment is extremely simple - whats important here is to understand the new way we are organising files.  You should have the following files

* **index.html** - usual stuff with all the html and script tags
* **main.css** - for styling.  At minimum you should use the bootstrap grid system but feel free to style however you would like.
* **main.js** - the entry point to your app
* **store.js** - should hold your book object as a private variable.  Should have an event listener for the add to cart button
* **cart.js** - should use a get method on the store module to get the price of the book. Should call the printToDom function and display the cart.
* **util.js** - should have the printToDom function.

## Planning Requrements
* Create a github project for this assignment.
* You should make cards/tickets based on deliverable features, i.e. .
