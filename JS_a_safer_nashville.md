# A Safer Nashville

Last week Mayor Cooper presented the steps that Nashville Metro will be required to take in order to start opening up. Unfortunately Mayor Cooper is a politician and as such the best way he could present this information is in a [Long Ass Document](https://www.asafenashville.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roadmap_For_Reopening_Nashville_Grid.pdf). Tables in PDF files are fine, but we're Web Developers with the power of CSS and JavaScript at our fingertips!

The goal of this challenge is to take the information from Mayor Cooper's [Long Ass Document](https://www.asafenashville.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roadmap_For_Reopening_Nashville_Grid.pdf) and present it more effectively, using the tools you've learned this far. In lieu of giving you explicit steps I'm going to let you go at it. The only requirements:

1. Use a loop/printToDom somewhere. One option is to store the "roadmap grid" into an array of objects (`steps`?), loop over it, and show it on a page prettier than the Mayor could.
1. Flex it up!
1. No really, make it look pretty. Or at least use a different color than a white background/black text. Heck go nuts and use a [google font](https://fonts.google.com/).

You'll note this is a pretty open assignment. You could display the information in the "grid" for each type of entity ("All Residents", "Healthcare & Dental", "Gyms & Fitness", etc.). Or you could choose to go a different route: distill down the rules in each section to be as readable for you and me as possible.

If you're feeling especially 🌶, throw some buttons on there to show only one type of thing at a time! Like Phase 1, then Phase 2, etc etc etc.

Mayor Cooper Thanks You!
